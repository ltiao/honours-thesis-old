+ Introduction
    * Motivation
        - Image processing applications
            Emphasize importance of locality for some signal processing applications
            + Border handling - linear filters
            + Digital image inpainting
                * roughly outline what professional conservator-restorer do manually
                * describe further applications
                    - red-eye, blemishes
                    - remove objects/text
                    - restoration
        - Fourier Series
        - Taylor Series
        - Draw Comparison
+ Background
    * Preliminaries
        - General fourier series
        - Legendre polynomials
        - Chromatic derivatives
        - Examples
        - Comparison
    * Related work
        Methods in the literature include

        Existing body of work is dominated by methods involving \textit{texture synthesis} - 
filling holes with repetitive two-dimensional textural patterns. 


        - structural inpainting
        - texture inpainting
        - combination
        we will consider this as part of our evaluation framework
        but main focus is to explore the novelty methods using chromatic derivatives
